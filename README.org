#+TITLE: Writing a Scheme in Haskell

* Start up
This project uses stack and cabal, so =stack run -- input= should work fine
(this is how I test it at least)

* Purpose

I did "build your own lisp" in C because I knew C but I didn't know how Lisps
and language implementations work. I'm doing "build your own scheme" in Haskell
because I'm starting to get how Scheme work (I intend to finish [[https://github.com/gagbo/xile][Xile]] some day)
but I don't know how to write Haskell. So that means :

- Scope :: I'll never finish this into a working Scheme implementation.

- Haskell project :: I only want to write some real Haskell "from scratch" in
  order to better understand how Haskell works, and hopefully make my Xmonad
  behave as I like (I think I have an issue with =Xmonad.Layout.Decoration=)
